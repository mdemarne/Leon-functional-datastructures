# Leon-functional-datastructures
Implementation of “Catenable List”  and “Binomial Heap” from the book “Purely Functional Datastructures” from Chris Okasaki, 1998.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to implement two data structures in a purely functional way that could be checked using Leon. 
We have implemented two types of data structures:

- Catenable Lists, which are list supporting merge operation efficiently
- Binomial Heaps, which are mergeable  (meldable) prority queues

## Running The Prroject

In order to run the various tests, you can:

- Use Leon on the command line: https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon
- use the Leon web interface by copy-pasting: http://leon.epfl.ch/
- Compile the test files along with the source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29990106/how-do-i-build-with-scalac-using-leons-library
