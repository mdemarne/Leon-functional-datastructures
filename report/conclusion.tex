To conclude with, we could implement two data structures in our project,
namely Catenable Lists and Binomial Heaps,
and we could check some operations on them.
Unfortunately, we have some unknown results, 
which are probably difficult to avoid 
when we have recursive definitions.

We could see some limitations and needed to find ways to circumvent them, 
being either library ones (like functions for Set) or syntactic ones.

It was nevertheless very interesting to use Leon and it helped us find some error 
in translating the book's implementation (\citep{Okasaki}).
