We were able to implement two data structures in our project,
namely Catenable Lists and Binomial Heaps,
and to check some operations on them.
Unfortunately Leon failed to prove or disprove some properties. 
However our experiments have shown 
that this is difficult to avoid with recursive definitions.

We were able to isolate some limitations and find ways to circumvent them, 
being either library ones (like operations on \texttt{Set}s which were not supported) 
or syntactic ones.

It was nevertheless very interesting to use Leon and it helped us find some error 
in translating the book's implementation (\citep{Okasaki}). 

Our implementation of the two data structures we have studied is of course purely functional.
