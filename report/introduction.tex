In this report we present two studies of data structures implemented in Leon. 
These implementations were done for the course \emph{Synthesis, Analysis and Verification} 2015 at EPFL.
We coded and verified some properties of
Catenable Lists and Binomial Heaps
implemented as described in \emph{"Purely Functional Data Structures"} from Chris Okasaki
\cite{Okasaki}.

The code for our project as well as the slides of our presentation 
can be found on GitHub
