In this report is presented our work on case studies of data structures in Leon
as project of the Synthesis, Analysis and Verification course 2015.
For this purpose, we coded in Leon and verified some properties of
the Catenable Lists and Binomial Heaps
implemented as described in "Purely Functional Data Structures" from Chris Okasaki
\cite{Okasaki}.
